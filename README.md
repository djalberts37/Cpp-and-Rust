# cpp-and-rust

## Overview

This repository demonstrates integration of Rust components into a C++ project using various techniques, including Foreign Function Interface (FFI) and third-party communction, such as Protocol Buffers. Rust is a powerful system programming language known for its safety features and performance, while C++ is widely used in system-level programming. This README provides instructions for integrating Rust components into a C++ project using different methods.

## Requirements

- Rust compiler (rustc)
- Cargo (Rust's package manager)
- C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, etc.)
- Protocol Buffers (protobuf) compiler and libraries
